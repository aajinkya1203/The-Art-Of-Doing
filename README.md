# Challenge 11 - Binary/Hexadecimal Converter


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will generate binary and hexadecimal values from
1 up to a specified user value. Recall that decimal is a base 10 number system, binary is a
base 2 number system, and hexadecimal is a base 16 number system. Your program will use
list slicing to first only show a portion of these values. Your program will then loop through the
entire lists of decimal, binary, and hexadecimal values to show the relationship between
numbers of different bases.
