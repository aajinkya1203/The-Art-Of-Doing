## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will create a list of a user’s favorite teachers. It
will display these teachers ranked (assuming the first teacher entered is the favorite, the second
teacher entered is the next favorite, ect…), alphabetically, in reverse alphabetical order, the top
two teachers, the next two teachers, the last favorite teacher, and the total number of favorite
teachers in the list. Your program will then add and remove teachers from this list, each time
