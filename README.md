# Challenge 34 - Head to Head Tic-Tac-Toe App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will allow two users to play a game of tic tac toe.
Your program should follow the standard rules in which two players alternate turns putting their
pieces, X or O, on a board. If a player has three pieces in a row, either vertically, horizontally,
or diagonally, they are declared the winner. You will represent the tic tac toe board using the
integers 1 through 9 for the 9 spaces on the board. An empty spot on the board will be
represented by an underscore “_”. For example, if a player would like to put a piece in the
center of the board they would enter 5 as their move.
