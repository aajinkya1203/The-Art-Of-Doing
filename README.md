# Challenge 7 - Different Types of Lists Program App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will highlight the similarities and differences
between four different types of lists: a list of strings, a list of integers, a list of floats, and a list of
lists. For each list, your program will describe the data type of the list, the elements of the list,
and the data type of the first element in the list. Your program will then highlight the similarities
and differences between sorting a list numerically and alphabetically.

## Challenge Test Case:

- Input

     _Hard Code values for different lists_


- Output

    ```
    The variable num_strings is a <class 'list'>.
    It contains the elements: ['15', '100', '55', '42']
    The element 15 is a <class 'str'>.
    
    The variable num_ints is a <class 'list'>.
    It contains the elements: [15, 100, 55, 42]
    The element 15 is a <class 'int'>.
    
    The variable num_floats is a <class 'list'>.
    It contains the elements: [2.2, 5.0, 1.245, 0.142857]
    The element 2.2 is a <class 'float'>.

    The variable num_lists is a <class 'list'>.
    It contains the elements: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    The element [1, 2, 3] is a <class 'list'>.

     ```
