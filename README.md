# Challenge 30 - Epidemic Outbreak GUI App


## Challenge Description:

You will be responsible for writing a program that simulates the spread of an infectious disease
throughout a population similar to the previous program. Using classes, you will model an
individual person’s and an entire population’s attributes and behaviors. Your program will allow
users to set various initial conditions in regards to the infection such as population size, infection
rate, mortality rate, and infection duration. The program will then simulate the interaction of
people within a population and spread the disease. Each iteration of spreading the disease will
result in a summary displaying statistics of the population. This time however, rather than storing
the population in a list and checking if the person to the left or right of the current person is
infected, we will store the population in a two dimensional list using nested for loops. This will
allow us to check for infections both to the left and right and above and below. This added
feature will help allow the program to create a Graphical User Interface or GUI (goo-e) to
visually show the spread of the infection. Rather than representing the spread of the infection
using O, I, and X in the terminal, each person in the population will be represented by a color
square in a GUI; green being healthy, yellow being infected, and red being dead.
