# Challenge 32 - The Python Calculator App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that simulates a calculator application that will take in
any two numbers, and a basic mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, or exponentiation), perform that operation, print a lexical statement of the operation,
and return a mathematical statement that describes the mathematical results. Upon completion,
your program will print out a history of all calculations performed including any error messages
that may have occurred such as division by zero.
