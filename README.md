# Challenge 29 - Guess My Word App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that plays a word guessing game with a user. Your
program will provide a category of words to the user and a string of dashes “-----” that represent
the length of the word. The user will guess the word and with each incorrect guess, your
program will reveal a letter at random, “-a---”. Upon guessing the word correctly, your program
will then inform the user how many guesses they took.
