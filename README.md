# Challenge 15 - Average Calculator App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will collect any number of grades from a user.
Your program will sort these grades numerically from highest to lowest and calculate the grade
point average of the user. Your program will then ask for the average the user desires and
calculate what the user must get on their next assignment to achieve this average. Lastly, your
program will make a copy of the users grades and allow them to alter one of their previous
grades to see how doing worse or better on an assignment would have changed their overall
average.
