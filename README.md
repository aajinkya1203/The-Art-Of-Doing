# The-Art-Of-Doing
A Collection of 40 different Python Based apps whose difficulty increases linearly!

> Feel free to try any of the challenges and maybe take a sneak peek into the code if you get stuck at some point! I have tried to make it as descriptive as possible with the help of comments! :wink:

_This idea was inspired by the creator Michael Eramo and his [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-art-of-doing/) for brushing up on some Python programming skills!_
