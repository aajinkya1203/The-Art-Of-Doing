# Challenge 23 - Yes Or No Polling App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will conduct a poll on a yes or no issue. Upon
starting the program a user will be prompted for an issue to vote on, the number of voters, and a
password to view the poll results. You program will then conduct the poll. Each time a user
votes, your program will ask for the voters full name to verify that they have not yet voted. If the
voter has not yet voted, they will be presented with the issue and can vote yes or no. The vote
will be recorded. Once the number of voters specified by the user has been reached, the poll
will close and a summary will be displayed. If the user enters the correct password a result of
each voters name and how they voted will be displayed.
