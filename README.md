# Challenge 35 - Loan Calculator App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that gathers information about a loan such as starting
principal, interest rate, and desired monthly payment. From this information, your program will
first determine if it is possible to pay off the loan based on the desired monthly payment. If it is
possible, your program will simulate making monthly payments until the loan is completely paid
off. Your program will then display statistics such as how long it took to pay the loan off, the
total amount spent on the loan, and the amount spent on interest. For simplicity, we will
assume that the loan compounds once a month, or twelve times in a year. Upon completion of
paying off the Loan, your program will make a graph showing the rate of change of the principal
to time using the matplotlib library.
