# Challenge 19 - Guess My Number App


## Challenge Description:

You are responsible for writing a program that will play the classic “Hi Low” game. Your
program will randomly pick a number between 1 and 20. Users will then guess the number.
With each guess, your program will respond that the user’s guess is either too high or too low.
When the user guesses correct, or after 5 guesses, your program will end the game and
summarize the results.
